### Tinder for express shopping and payments

This app leverages on Masterpass for a quick payment system that reduces the friction between shopping and cart checkout by streamlining the submission of a customer's billing information. In addition, we go a step further to provide customers with the ability to engage with a personal sales assistant upon request, aided through data visualization of the store's activity level. Customers can then go down to the physical stores to experience the product before making a decision. In this way, we are bridging the gap between the online and offline retail experience, to provide customers with a multi-sensory and holistic shopping spree.
